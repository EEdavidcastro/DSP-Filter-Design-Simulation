# Filter Design Project

This is a low-pass filter designed under certain constraints with the aim of minimizing quantization effects. The code simulates fixed point quantization and the filter itself. Graphs are also produced from the MATLAB code, showcasing the amount of bits (word-length) in order to meet the desired SNR.  The constraints and explanations can be seen in the report file. The filter design is done in MATLAB with quantization effects simulated.
